Welcome to my Visual Interfacing Structure (VIS)!

Not much more than a framework for using tkinter right now 
Hopefully similar to Ruby on Rails.

Current capabilities include:
  add screen - creates a screen and all necessary files for format
  new - initializes the current folder as a vis project
